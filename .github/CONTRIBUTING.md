### Don't change these files:
- **Anything you don't really need to change, don't change**. Randomly changing files is useless, and could be destructive if you don't know what you're doing.
- `.gitignore` - `/.gitignore` - Don't change the .gitignore unless this is useful or necessary.


## Follow these steps to make your Pull Request

### Make your edits
1. **[Fork this repository](https://github.com/afkvido/MinecraftDungeonsModpacks/fork)**. You'll push your edits to your fork.
5. **Actually test what you've made**. Non-tested PRs are quite worthless, because those only "theoretically" work.
6. **Check your changed files**. If something seems wrong, don't commit that file. Try again.


### Open your pull request
1. Enable `Allow Updates from Maintainers`. Otherwise, we can't do small changes like update the version, or fix something that you did poorly. Chances are, we won't merge your PR if you don't enable this.
2. Provide a detailed description of your changes. Also, make a quality title that describes what you change.
3. Submit your pull request.
